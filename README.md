# Classification-R

During this report we will devote ourselves to a data exploration and to carry out a modeling by classification of the model .

The data set contains the expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control mice and Down syndrome exposed to contextual fear conditioning, a task used to assess learning in mice.

Our problem generally is a problem of classifying the Behavior of the mice into two groups simulated to learn (CS / SC), it is a binary variable which corresponds to an affirmation or not of the learning of the mice , so in order to solve and give an approach to this type of classification problem.
